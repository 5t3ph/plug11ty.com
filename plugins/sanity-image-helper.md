# Use Sanity's Asset Pipeline with 11ty

## Alpha Release

This plugin is a template helper to connect Sanity's Asset Pipelines to your 11ty templates for images. This is currently in early stages.

This plugin gives you access to helper tags to get your Images from Sanity's CDN and perform simple transformations (width/height) and a responsive image helper to create dynamic srcsets.
